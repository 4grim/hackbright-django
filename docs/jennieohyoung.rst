Things that worked well
-----------------------

* Step by step tutorial that is mostly clear and easy to follow
* Community cheatsheet kept everyone in the loop and gave very helpful tips



Things that I had questions about 
---------------------------------

* It would be great if there's a snapshot at the end of each section so the students can quickly pinpoint where their mistakes are in their code (if any), it's also a great way to make sure everyone is at the same starting point for the next section.
* I think the Django documentation should attache a high level overview/intro for new learners, as well as a list of helpful concepts such as MVC, virtualenv, gitignore, github etc.
